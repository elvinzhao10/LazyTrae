# LazyTrae v1.0.3 — Adaptive Harness

**Release date:** 2026-07-20
**Status:** Release-ready commits and artifacts only. Not pushed, tagged, or
published.

## What's new

v1.0.3 turns LazyTrae's menu of named workflows into one adaptive experience.
You state the outcome; the harness selects the smallest sufficient workflow,
composes the specialists and capabilities it needs, explains the material
choices, escalates only when evidence requires it, and resumes through the
existing runtime state.

## Outcome-first adaptive selection

When you describe an outcome without naming a workflow, the adaptive harness
picks a mode for you. It does not replace the workflows you already know — it
chooses among them. If you name one explicitly, that request stays
authoritative.

## Five workflow modes

The harness selects one of five modes, each mapping onto existing LazyTrae
surfaces (Skills, commands, agents, MCP, local tooling, verification gates):

| Mode | When it applies |
| --- | --- |
| **direct** | Small, localized, low-risk change with clear acceptance criteria. |
| **assisted** | Unfamiliar or cross-file diagnostic work that needs exploration first. |
| **planned** | Broad or ambiguous work where decisions must be resolved before editing. |
| **orchestrated** | Security-sensitive, release, or multi-system work needing independent review. |
| **long-horizon** | Multi-session work needing durable checkpoints and a continuation loop. |

The policy always picks the **lowest** mode that satisfies the identified
risk, uncertainty, and verification requirements. It never escalates just
because more capabilities are available.

## Automatic specialist and capability composition

The harness dynamically selects existing Skills, agent responsibilities, MCP
capabilities, local tools, hooks, and verification depth. It reuses what is
already installed and declared — it does not install new commands, hooks, or
providers per task. One owner is assigned to each implementation stage;
parallel agents are used only for genuinely independent work.

## Explicit override remains authoritative

Named workflows — `lazy-ulw-plan`, `lazy-start-work`, `lazy-review-work`,
`lazy-ulw-loop`, and others — remain fully authoritative. If you ask for a
plan only, you get planning. If you ask for a direct fix, the harness will not
silently insert a planning stage unless safety or missing authority requires
it. The classifier may add required verification or approval boundaries, but
it never silently downgrades or replaces an explicit request.

## Bounded escalation

A targeted verification failure adds a debugging stage. A failure that
reveals broader scope may increase the mode by one level. An unavailable
capability uses a safe fallback before increasing workflow depth. The harness
performs **at most two automatic depth escalations** per decision. After
that, it produces a blocked-state record with the reproduced failure,
attempted approaches, current evidence, and the exact next user decision
needed — rather than looping indefinitely.

## Concise orchestration explanation

Every decision is surfaced through the existing `completion-status` command.
The explanation shows the selected mode, stages, responsibilities, and
capabilities, plus what was **not** selected and why. When a capability
fallback occurs, the `Substituted:` section reports the substitution and its
effect on evidence strength — so you never see a silent downgrade.

## Lightweight continuation snapshot

The harness writes an optional, additive `adaptive` block into the existing
loop/run state. It records the decision, current stage, runtime resolution,
escalation count, revision marker, and next action. The block is
single-writer (only the adaptive orchestrator writes it), backward-compatible
(v1.0.2 state without the block loads unchanged), and adds no new locks or
compare-and-swap machinery.

## Capability-qualified Trae mapping

The same adaptive contract maps onto Trae IDE, Trae Work, and Trae CLI. Each
host is qualified by its available surface — the harness uses what each host
provides without fabricating parity for unavailable or unverified functions.

## Unchanged authority and host-readiness boundaries

- **Authority:** read-only and package-owned capabilities activate
  automatically. Installations, persistence, host settings, credentials,
  browser/desktop control, remote access, and data egress still require
  explicit approval. No hidden host mutation occurs.
- **Host readiness:** package evidence is not live-host evidence. Package
  checks validate local files and declarations only; host discovery, hook
  execution, and MCP connection remain PENDING until observed in a fresh
  session.
- **No new MCP servers, remote providers, host settings, or production
  dependencies.** No cross-repository runtime dependencies. No state-store
  replacement or memory migration.

## Known gaps (deferred to v1.0.4)

- **Continuation resume:** the classifier does not yet resume from compatible
  snapshots. Every request produces a fresh decision. Pinned by xfail tests.
- **Evidence freshness:** `revisionMarker` is constant; stale snapshot
  detection and the re-verification trigger signal are not implemented.
  Pinned by xfail tests.
- **Live-host QA:** Trae IDE, Trae Work, and Trae CLI live-host verification
  is PENDING — no live host was available in the release session. Package
  evidence and fixture-based parity are verified; live-host evidence was not
  captured.

## Cross-repo parity

LazyTrae and LazyBuddy consume the same byte-identical
`adaptive-harness-contract.v1.json` and the same ten behavioral fixtures,
with paired sha256 digest parity. Equivalent requests produce equivalent
user-level modes, responsibilities, approval boundaries, and verification
gates — with no runtime coupling between repositories.
